# Onboarding a New Google Sheet

## Steps

1.  **Register Sheet ID:**
    Add your Sheet ID (from the URL: `.../d/SHEET_ID/edit...`) to the [Record ID Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qCXZyon6chwQreXi8eBbaZ6Qmu5jWwJ2bFcvvVUmqXk/edit?usp=sharing).

2.  **Grant Access:**
    Share your sheet with **Editor** access to the following emails:
    *   `swipekiosk@swipekiosk.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
    *   `tltmedialab@connect.stonybrook.edu`

3.  **Complete:**
    Professors listed in the sheet will automatically begin receiving emails about new applicants.




## Important Considerations

To ensure optimal functionality and a consistent design approach within this project, please adhere to the following column naming conventions in your Google Sheet:

*   Utilize separate columns for `First Name` and `Last Name` instead of a single `Name` column.
*   Ensure the column name containing professor email addresses includes 'email address'.

Following this structure will support a more consistent design approach.
